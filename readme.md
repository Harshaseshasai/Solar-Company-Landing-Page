## 🎯 Project Overview: First Paid Project

This project was developed for a leading solar installation company in Kakinada, East Godavari. My primary goal was to create a high-performance, fully responsive, and SEO-optimized web presence that accurately showcases the client's services and portfolio. This site achieved a top search engine ranking shortly after launch.
